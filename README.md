# Simple Linear Regression Model  

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. It covers the steps from data preparation to evaluation and visualization of the results.  

---

## Project Objectives  
1. Implement a simple linear regression model.  
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
3. Train the model on the training data.  
4. Evaluate model performance using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (R²)**.  
5. Visualize the regression line and compare actual vs. predicted values.  

---

## Prerequisites  
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.x  
- Libraries:  
  - `numpy`  
  - `pandas`  
  - `matplotlib`  
  - `seaborn`  
  - `scikit-learn`  

Install the required libraries using:  
```bash  
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn  
```  

---

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project should contain:  
1. One independent variable (predictor).  
2. One dependent variable (target).  

If you have your own dataset, ensure it meets these criteria. Alternatively, sample datasets like the **Boston Housing Dataset** or synthetic data can be used.  

---

## Workflow  
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:  
   - Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.  
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships and check for missing values.  

2. **Splitting Data**:  
   - Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using `train_test_split` from `scikit-learn`.  

3. **Training the Model**:  
   - Fit the linear regression model using the training data.  

4. **Model Evaluation**:  
   - Evaluate performance on the test set using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (R²)** metrics.  

5. **Visualization**:  
   - Plot the regression line on the training data.  
   - Visualize actual vs. predicted values using a scatter plot.  

6. **Prediction**:  
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.  

---

## Evaluation Metrics  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values. Lower is better.  
- **R-squared (R²)**: Represents the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model. Higher is better.  

---

## Visualization  
1. **Regression Line**: A line fitted to the training data showing the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.  
2. **Actual vs. Predicted Values**: A scatter plot showing the alignment of predictions with actual test data values.  

---

## Example Usage  
Here’s how to run the script:  
1. Place the dataset (`data.csv`) in the project directory.  
2. Modify the script to specify the column names for independent and dependent variables.  
3. Run the script:  
   ```bash  
   python linear_regression.py  
   ```  

---

## Results  
The model's performance and visualizations will be displayed:  
- MSE and R² metrics in the console.  
- Plots showing the regression line and actual vs. predicted values.
